### Hey! My name is Fellipe and I'm a self-taught programmer and self-taught musicist.
<br>


I'm an enthusiast of math and science and spend most of my day studying different technologies that relate to programming and working on projects where I can apply them.

My main technologies:
- Javascript
- HTML and CSS
- PHP
- Python
- MySQL and SQL Server
- C#
- C++

Here's a few projects I have worked on by myself in my 8 months of self-taught progress, that are worth mentioning:

-[Helenium System](https://github.com/luizfellips/P.D.V-SistemaHelenium) - P.O.S System W.I.P
- [Analisystem web C.R.U.D](https://github.com/luizfellips/websystem) - An online web-system C.R.U.D open project made with HTML,Bootstrap, jQuery, PHP and mySQL.
- [Commercial Representative System](https://github.com/luizfellips/Commercial-Representation-System) - A system I made for my father to facilitate the visualization and fill of data structures important to his job
- [Whatsapp Advertising Bot](https://github.com/luizfellips/Whatsapp-Bot) - A whatsapp bot with an interface I have written to advertise a database of electronic products(with image and description)
