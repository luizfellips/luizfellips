### Hey! My name is Fellipe and I'm a self-taught programmer.
<br>


I'm an enthusiast of math, science and design and spend most of my day studying different technologies that relate to programming and working on projects where I can apply them.

My emphasis has always been towards back-end development(more specifically for desktop applications), using **Python** as my main language.

However I've been exploring seas beyond my comfort zone such as C++ and the front-end pillars(HTML,CSS and Javascript).

In top of these, here's a few projects I have worked on by myself in my 7 months of self-taught progress, that are worth mentioning:

- [Bootstrap Front-end Project](https://luizfellips.github.io/mandala-website-bootstrap/) - Project I'm working on to study Bootstrap, HTML and CSS(and soon enough, scripting frameworks such as React)
- [Commercial Representative System](https://github.com/luizfellips/Commercial-Representation-System) - A system I made for my father to facilitate the visualization and fill of data structures important to his job
- [Whatsapp Advertising Bot](https://github.com/luizfellips/Whatsapp-Bot) - A whatsapp bot with interface I written to advertise a database of electronic products(with image and description)
