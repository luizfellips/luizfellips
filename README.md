### Hey! My name is Fellipe and I'm a self-taught programmer and english speaker.

I'm an enthusiast of math, science and design and spend most of my day studying different technologies that relate to programming and working on projects where I can apply them.

My emphasis has always been towards back-end development(more specifically for desktop applications), using **Python** as my main language.

However I've been exploring seas beyond my comfort zone such as C++ and the front-end pillars(HTML,CSS and Javascript).

In top of these, here's a few projects I have worked on by myself in my 7 months of self-taught progress(purely in **PYTHON**), that are worth mentioning:

- [Commercial Representative System](https://github.com/luizfellips/Commercial-Representation-System) - A system I made for my father to facilitate the visualization and fill of data structures important to his job
- [Whatsapp Advertising Bot](https://github.com/luizfellips/Whatsapp-Bot) - A whatsapp bot with interface I written to advertise a database of electronic products(with image and description)
